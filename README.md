# Force Dimension ROS2 examples

This package provides Python implementations of various examples provided in 
the Force Dimension haptics and robotics software development kit (SDK). This 
package is intended as a companion to -- and depends on -- the 
[ROS2 Force Dimension package]. All of the implementations use ROS2.

## Installation

The `colcon` utility is used to [build ROS2 packages]. This package should be 
part of a [ROS2 workspace] that includes the [ROS2 Force Dimension package].

## Usage

See the documentation for individual examples for usage information. Currently, 
the following examples are implemented:

* [`segment`](/doc/markdown/segment)
